                    <h3>RIDE4FUN tours</h3>
                    <p>Our RIDE4FUN tours are all about riding, riding, and even more riding. There will be less sightseeing than on other Edelweiss tours, but in return, we collect more miles. “Regional and local” is our motto on these tours as we discover roads and areas which normally only locals know. We stay in hotels with plenty of local charm, not inappropriately expensive or fancy, but comfortable. During the day, you can ride in a group with your tour guide or in your own little group-you decide! There won't be any luggage service on these tours, which means that you need to pack your sweater, socks, and toothbrush on your bike-which is no problem since all our motorcycles come with a full luggage system. Our advice when riding with a passenger: clarify in advance if your passenger not only likes this kind of tour but also has the necessary experience for it. If so, then we can only wish you lots of fun!</p>

                    <h3>TRAINING tours</h3>
                    <p>Riding a motorcycle should be fun, but safety always has priority! Therefore, we have developed a special riding training that will improve your skills and thus the riding fun and safety on tour. Imparting theoretical knowledge is of course a prerequisite and forms the basis for the initial training on a circuit with our trained riding instructors. Here everything from motorcycle handling to cornering techniques to braking maneuvers is taught and practiced. However, since training on a circuit can never reflect real-life situations, we will put what we have learned into practice in a two-day excursion from our 4-star base hotel. After this riding training you will be able to master a wide variety of roads, passes, and situations with confidence and be a much better rider than before. So you can twist the throttle on tour without neglecting safety.
